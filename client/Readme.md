# MTGRender

## TODO list

-   Priorities:
-   -   ~~Extended Art support~~
-   -   -   ~~Extend even more to cover added border on render when possible~~
-   -   Rethink card hierarchy: inner-frame filter shouldn't apply to its current current child, probably flatten everything.
-   ~~Support for Planeswalkers~~
-   -   ~~Redo borders to cover the curse of the illustration frame~~
-   -   Alternating background tint on abilities
-   -   ~~Add support for the "\_large" version for the frame~~
-   -   Way harder: Allow for dynamic sizing of frame and background! (dynamic svg for the frame?)
-   Support for MDFCs
-   -   ~~Basic support for card faces display~~
-   -   ~~Rendering should aware that there is two faces to render~~
-   -   Editing UI should be aware too
-   -   ~~Add the MDFC icon (top left)~~
-   -   ~~Add the MDFC hint regarding the over side (type and mana cost)~~
-   -   MDFC extended art frame
-   Support for Planeswalker MDFC
-   -   Hybrid frame
-   ~~Support Adventure frame~~
-   -   Support for multiple face edition in UI (MDFCs/Adventures)
-   Support "watermark" property
-   Support for custom set icon override
-   -   Switch to svg based icon + css rarity tint rather than keyrune
-   -   Allow for custom placement of the icon
-   ~~Illustration upscaling~~
-   Optimize the render PNG? (20MB+ files is meh.)
-   Webworker for client-zip
-   Display a warning for overriden card properties in UI
