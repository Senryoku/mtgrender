## TODO list

-   Convert all images to webp (massive gains)
-   Remove everything from under .inner-frame: the filter applied on this element messed a lot of things (for example the drop shadow will be visible behind the transparent oracle box of planeswalkers, darkening the illustration)
-   ~~Support for Planeswalkers~~
-   -   ~~Alternating background tint on abilities~~
-   Support for Planeswalker MDFC
-   -   Hybrid frame
-   Support "watermark" property
-   Support for custom set icon override
-   -   Allow for custom placement of the icon?
-   Webworker for client-zip
-   Display a warning for overriden card properties in UI
